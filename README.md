# Lab 1 
## Part I: Introduction to Qiskit
### I.1: Basic Rotations on One Qubit and Measurements on the Bloch Sphere
#### 1.) Let us start easy by performing a bit flip. The goal is to reach the state |1>
#### 2.) Next, we would like to create superposition. The goal is to reach the state |+> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>+|1>)
#### 3.) Let's combine those two. The goal is to reach the state .|-> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>-|1>)
#### 4.) Finally, we move on to the complex numbers. The goal is to reach the state |-i> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>-i|1>) .
### I.2: Quantum Circuits Using Multi-Qubit Gates
#### 5.) Construct the Bell state
#### 6.) Write a function that builds a quantum circuit on 3 qubits and creates the GHZ-like state.

## Part II: Oracles and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
### II.1: Deutsch-Jozsa Problem
### II.2: Quantum Solution to the Deutsch-Josza Problem


# Lab2: Introduction to Variational Algorithms
We learned in this lab the following topics 
    ## variational quantum algorithms, in particular Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
    ## how to create and work with parameterized circuits and quadratic programs in Qiskit
    ## how to solve optimization problems using QAOA
    
    
# Lab 3: Quantum Kernels and Support Vector Machines
## We discovered how to use quantum support vector classification, quantum kernels, and quantum feature maps in Qiskit in this lab.

# lab 4: Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits
## We took a closer look at how to train circuit-based models in this lab session. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to construct variational quantum classifiers, employ a variety of training methods, including gradient-based methods, and understand the limitations of variational-based models and how to get around them.


# lab 5 :
## In this lab, We utilised quantum process tomography to observe how noise impacts a common parameterized quantum circuit used in machine learning.
